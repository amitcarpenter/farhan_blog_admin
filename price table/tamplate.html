        <h2>Q Condos - Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Q Condos will be the beacon of Kitchener’s creative scene. Its slender design will rise 34 storeys above Queen Street's creative vibe.
            Overlooking Victoria Park, the location is steps from an ION transit stop and is surrounded by tech jobs, restaurants, art galleries, and theaters.
            Live close to world-class universities and college campuses, and walk to work at any one of the dozens of technology companies calling downtown Kitchener home – like Google, Communitech, Apply Board, and Vid Yard.
            The new transit hub will connect the ION light rail transit, Grand River Transit, expanded GO train and bus service, VIA Rail, Coach Canada, CarShare, cyclists, and pedestrians.
        </p>
        <p>Put your feet up in Vogelsang Green, or kick them up in Victoria Park. Head to the theater, a local bar, a concert, the library, a museum, Farmer’s Market, or an art gallery. It's playtime near Q Condos.</p>
        <p>This is your opportunity to own a suite in robust Downtown Kitchener.</p>
